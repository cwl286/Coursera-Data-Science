# CTA Red Line Ridership in 2015

## Welcome

You can use this app to examine the Chicago Transit Authority's 'L' Station Entries data set.

The original data set has almost 800,000 rows. To keep the plot manageable, I subsetted the original data set to only have Red Line stations and I have restricted the year to 2015.

The original data set can be found [here](https://data.cityofchicago.org/Transportation/CTA-Ridership-L-Station-Entries-Daily-Totals/5neh-572f).
The source code for the app can be found at [GitHub](https://github.com/ugaliguy/Coursera-Data-Science/tree/master/Developing-Data-Products/shiny-app).

## Using the App

At the top of this page, there are tabs for viewing the table and viewing a plot of the data.
If you want to view the original data, click the **Table** tab. You can view all of the data or restrict the data to a particular date, a particular station, or both. Clicking on individual columns will order the rows in ascending or descending order.

To view a plot of the data, click on **Statistics**. You can view all of the data or restrict the data to a particular date, a particular station, or both.

* Extend this the entire data set - which covers 147 stations and the years 2001 - 2016
* Allow for information to be displayed by train line (not just by station)
* Breakdown 'Weekday' data into each day of the week  
* Calculate more statistics
